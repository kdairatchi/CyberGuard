**Installation**
---------------

To install CyberGuard, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kdairatchi/CyberGuard.git`
2.  Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Create a `data.csv` file with the following format:
    ```
"IP Address","Port","Protocol","Vulnerability"
"192.168.1.1",22,"TCP",1
"192.168.1.1",80,"TCP",0
"192.168.1.1",443,"TCP",1
"192.168.1.2",22,"TCP",0
"192.168.1.2",80,"TCP",1
```
4.  Train the AI model: `python cyberguard.py train data.csv`

**Usage**
-----

To use CyberGuard, follow these steps:

1.  Scan the network: `python cyberguard.py scan_network 192.168.1.0/24`
2.  Scan the ports: `python cyberguard.py scan_ports 192.168.1.100 22 80 443`
3.  Detect vulnerabilities: `python cyberguard.py detect_vulnerabilities 192.168.1.100 22 80 443`
4.  Provide recommendations: `python cyberguard.py provide_recommendations 192.168.1.100 22 80 443`

**Customization**
--------------

You can customize CyberGuard by modifying the `cyberguard.py` script. You can add or remove features, change the AI model, and modify the scanning and detection algorithms.

**User-Friendly Interface**
-------------------------

You can create a user-friendly interface for CyberGuard using a GUI library such as Tkinter or PyQt. This will allow users to interact with the tool more easily and provide a more intuitive experience.
